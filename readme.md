# Travel Agency Site

Hi! This is a project developed with the intention to practicing HTML and CSS.

Nice things that could be learned from this project:

-   Flexbox concepts
    -   We covered the basics of flexbox, like: flex-direction, justify-content and align-items
-   How to integrate with google maps
    -   The site contact section uses a map to show the address, for that we used google maps integration and documentation.
-   Media queries
    -   All the site is responsive for smartphones, tablets and desktops.
